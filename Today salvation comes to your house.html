<h2><em><b> TODAY SALVATION HAS COME TO YOUR HOUSE</em></b></h2>
<h2>Bible Passage:Luke 19:9</h2>
<p> According to the book of Luke chapter 19, Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and there was a man named Zaccheus who sought to see what our Lord Jesus Christ looked like. Zaccheus could not see what Jesus looked like initially, because he had a challenge which was his short stature. To overcome this, Zaccheus ran ahead and climbed up into a sycomore tree to be able to see Jesus as he is passing by. When Jesus reached where the sycomore tree was, He instructed Zacchaeus to come down and informed Zacchaeus that He would abide at his house on that very day. Zaccheus thereafter made restitution for his sinful ways by giving half of his goods to the poor.</P>

<P>Are you like Zaccheus? Are you overburdened by the heavy load of sin, just like Zaccheus? Lay it down at the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ. He said:" Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." (Mathew 11:28). Jesus is calling you today as he has said to Zaccheus in the book of  Luke 19:9:<em> "And  Jesus said unto him, this day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham".</em> 

<p> To Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour and be free from the yoke of sin simply say this prayer: Dear Lord Jesus, thank you for dying on the cross for my sin. Please forgive me. Come into my life. I receive You as my Lord and Savior. Now, help me to live for you the rest of this life.
In the name of Jesus, I pray.
Amen.</P>
